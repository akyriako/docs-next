# Keycloak

Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management (IAM) solution
developed by Red Hat. It provides features for single sign-on (SSO),
user authentication, authorization, and identity brokering. Keycloak
aims to simplify the implementation of authentication and authorization
mechanisms in applications by offering a centralized and configurable
platform.

## Key Features

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Keycloak enables users to log in once and
    gain access to multiple applications without the need to re-enter
    credentials for each application.
2. **Identity Federation:** It supports identity brokering, allowing
    users to log in with existing accounts from social networks (such as
    Google, Facebook, or GitHub) or other identity providers.
3. **User Authentication:** Keycloak provides a variety of
    authentication mechanisms, including username and password,
    multi-factor authentication, and support for external identity
    providers.
4. **Authorization Services:** It includes fine-grained access control
    and authorization policies to manage what users can and cannot do
    within applications.
5. **User Account Management:** Keycloak offers user self-registration,
    password reset, and other account management features.
6. **LDAP and Active Directory Integration:** It supports integration
    with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and Microsoft
    Active Directory for seamless user management.
7. **Client Adapters:** Keycloak provides client adapters for various
    platforms and languages, making it easier to integrate with
    applications built using different technologies.
8. **Security and Compliance:** Keycloak follows best practices for
    security and compliance, including support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID
    Connect standards.

Developers can integrate Keycloak with their applications using various
protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, SAML (Security Assertion
Markup Language), and more. It is commonly used in microservices
architectures and distributed systems to manage authentication and
authorization in a centralized manner. Keycloak is often employed in
scenarios where secure user authentication and access control are
crucial, such as enterprise applications, web applications, and APIs.
